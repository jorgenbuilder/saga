# uTarot Ecosystem / Saga Open Business Model

## Introduction

**I.**

Games like *MTG Arena* and *Hearthstone* are shining examples of how to create a digital love letter to a traditional card game. In these games, cards have tactile qualities nostalgic of their physical counterparts: physics-based animation and glossy card materials tug at your notions of the real. Unshackled from paper media, cards are transmuted with digital flare: animated card faces, particle effects, great sound design... plus all of the rules and tidy-up are handled for you!

An analogous experience for Tarot doesn't exist—there are one or two really good digital Tarot experiences, but nothing that approaches that *Blizzard-before-Activision-esque* feeling of quality. Saga's original idea and it's first order priority is to give the digital Tarot experience a *Hearthstonian* feeling of physical quality blended with digital delight.

Put more romantically, our goal is nothing short of innervating digital experiences with the real soul of Tarot, and breathing new life into the game.

**II.**

So—genuine, fantastic Tarot experiences are the point, but how we get there is just as important.  In fact, we believe that creating an open, permissionless Tarot economy that anyone can participate in at any level is just as tantalizing. We want to live in a world where digital goods that are yours are subject only to your whims, and the keys to the kingdom are held equally in open markets.

The code that powers the digital Tarot revolution won't be kept in an ivory tower: it will be out in the open, in a network of open source, interoperable software canisters. Any developer or artist that cares to learn the ecosystem will have all the same power to create as any “insider.” This living ecosystem of canisters (or amicably “cans,”) and it's standards could be referred to as “uTarot,” standing for “Universal Tarot.”

## Who Is Saga For?

We are Tarot enthusiasts, art enthusiasts, and collectors; but we're also technology enthusiasts and makers.

## Organization/Governance Structure

Maybe a hierarchy of SNS? Separate developer tokens?

## Taxation

All profit-making activities in the uTarot ecosystem will be subject to a flat tax, the rate of which will be configurable by governing communities, and the proceeds of which will be used to pay upkeep to the various communities that power the uTarot ecosystem.

*Not sure if this is the way to go. Maybe frame it is as marginal dollar equation, ex: $0.10 to X subcommunity, $0.05 to Y subcommunity, remainder to warchest. IDK, still not quite there... marginal allocation and taxation are different things. What about third parties that develop apps in the ecosystem?*

## Fundraising

- Auction one-of-one NFTs commemorating community milestones.

# Deck Canisters

## Purpose

A deck canister models a full deck of Tarot cards on the blockchain. More specifically it models the deck in abstract, such that many “copies” of that same deck can be maintained by a single canister. Good analogies for a Deck Canister would be a “print run” of physical Tarot cards, or a “class” in computer programming.

Many functionalities are natural to model in a Deck Can, and some are better captured elsewhere. While not an authoritative statement, a good thought experiment for what should be modelled by the Deck Canister is to picture a real, physical Tarot deck. Any of the more-or-less immutable properties (or functionalities) of that deck might be natural candidates for representation on the blockchain (art, dimensions, etc.,) whereas the mutable state of the deck is better left to clientside implementations (position, order, etc..)

# Deck Registry Canister

## Purpose

The uTarot design allows for an unbounded number of Deck Canisters. This presents the need for discoverability of these “Deck Cans” for any application that would integrate with the uTatot ecosystem. Instead of requiring each application to roll its own solution to this problem, the Deck Registry Canister is proposed to be a one-stop solution to the discovery problem.
 
uTarot posits that any canister which provides the required common interfaces can be considered a Deck Can. This presents two additional issues that the Deck Registry Canister can tackle. First, validation of the required common interface as a prerequisite to becoming listed in the Registry (ideally this should be permissionless automated self-registry.) Second, this lowers the barrier to entry in a way that is on-the-whole positive because it is inclusive and open, but also allows for potentially damaging content to enter the ecosystem. The Deck Registry Can is a natural place to allow the Tarot community to govern its content; providing additional certifications where they are deemed necessary, relevant or worthy, and perhaps delisting when necessary.

## Governance Process
 
In keeping with the open business model of uTarot and Saga, the governance process should be owned and conducted by members of the online Tarot community. The subcommunity of Deck Registry Governance must maintain a clear and accessible document that outlines its governance policies. Any governance actions taken must have a valid reference in

# Problems That People Have With Digital Tarot

r/tarot is a goldmine of market research for what people *don't* like about digital Tarot, and there's a couple gems about what people *do* like about it in there too.
